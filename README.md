# futurerestore-inferius

**THIS SCRIPT IS ONLY FOR LINUX! THE COMPILED BUILD WILL ***NOT RUN ON MACOS***. YOU HAVE TO COMPILE THE BUILD YOURSELF IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS ON MACOS.**

Run the script futurerestore-inferius-linux.sh on a debian docker container (docker run -it --name debian debian:buster-slim) to build the latest version of futurerestore with m1stadev's img4tool fork, or head over to the release tab to grab a precompiled one. 

The script was written by Cryptiiiic, modified by me to work correctly as of april 2022, and changed to m1stadev's img4tool repo.
